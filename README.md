# Simple calculator made using PHP

- This is my first time using PHP to make a project and I made a simple calculator that adds, subtracts, multiplies and divides.

- The layout isn't a structured calculator, but it still does what a calculator does and works.

## Software used: 
- PHP
- HTML
- Visual Studio Code
